Draft multilayer Leaflet map with clergy, cbo, and demographic layers

This is a demo of an interactive web mapping application, utilizing leaflet, cartoDB, and a little JQuery. Data sets from NYC DCP, NYC DOT, OpenData, and the MO CAU. 

This is not a final version. Lots of kinks to be worked out.
#TODO:
1. Create a legend for layers that need them (i.e. choropleths). This legend needs to either be in a sidebar DIV element or in a popup.
2. Make hover-over interactivity (or info-window) for polygons and points. (preferably with D3-style sidebar info).
3. Move layer selector to a collapsible sidebar.
4. Add log-in page.
5. Convert choropleth items to radio-button
