# web-map-demo  
Draft multilayer Leaflet map, creating for portfolio "sample of work"

This is a demo of an interactive web mapping application, utilizing leaflet, cartoDB, and a little JQuery. Data sets from NYC DCP (Bytes of the Big Apple), NYC DOT, OpenData, US Census Bureau and the MO-CAU. 

This is a draft version. Lots of kinks to be worked out.
